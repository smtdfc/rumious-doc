**Rumious** is a Frontend framework based on **Web Components**, enabling you to build modern interfaces without relying on Virtual DOM

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Web Components** – Fully compatible with any framework or works independently.
- **No Virtual DOM** – High performance with minimal resource usage.
- **Lifecycle Hooks Support** – Control the rendering and removal process of components.

## 📦 Installation

```sh
npm install @rumious/core @rumious/browser @rumious/cli
```

## 🔧 Basic Usage

Using **Rumious** to create custom components and apps is simple and efficient. Follow the steps below to get started with a basic example.

### 1. Create a New Project

Start by initializing a new Rumious project:

```sh
rumious init start-app
npm install
```

This command will generate a project directory with the basic structure and configuration files.

### 2. Create Your First App

Navigate to the _src/index.tsx_ file and add the following code:

```javascript
import { Fragment, createApp } from '@rumious/core';

const app = createApp({
  root: document.body,
});

app.setRootLayout(
  <Fragment>
    <h1>Hello Rumious</h1>
  </Fragment>,
);

app.start();
```

In this example, you are rendering a simple application with a heading and a button. When the button is clicked, an alert with "Hello Rumious!" is displayed.

### 3. Build and Test Your Project

Once you've created your app, you can build it and start testing it locally.

To build your project, run:

```sh
rumious dev
npx http-server ./public -p 3000
```

After the build is complete, open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to see the result of your app.

By following these steps, you’ve created your first Rumious app, showcasing the power of Web Components in a lightweight and performant way. You can now customize and expand your project with more components and logic as needed.
